.TH lpj.conf 5  "October 30, 2008" "version 3.5.005" "FILE FORMATS"
.SH NAME
lpj.conf \- Configuration file for LPJmL runs with natural vegetation
.SH DESCRIPTION
By default
.B lpj
reads in the
.I lpj.conf
file. This file is preprocessed by the
.B cpp
processor. 
The type of simulation can be changed by defining macros as runtime options of the
.B lpj
command.   
.PP
.SS Macro definitions
.TP
\-DFROM_RESTART
Simulation is started from a restart file.
.TP
\-DISRANDOM
A random precipitation generator is used. The number of wet days in a month is used as an additional input variable
.TP
\-DRIVER_ROUTING
Simulation is performed with river routing. Input file for drainage has to be provided.
.TP
\-WITH_GRIDBASED
PFT-specific output is grid scaled.
.SS File structure
The LPJmL configuration file contains integer, float, and string values. Strings containing white spaces must be delimited by '"'. The file \fIinclude/conf.h\fP has to be included for the definition of symbols.
The file is divided into five different sections: 
.TP
I. Simulation description and type section
The first two entries describe the simulation and its type:

.nf
#include "include/conf.h"
Simulation description string (string)
LPJ  /* Simulation type with natural vegetation */
INTERPOLATE_PREC | RANDOM_PREC random seed (int)
CLOUDINESS | RADIATION | RADIATION_SWONLY | RADIATION_LWDOWN
NO_FIRE | FIRE
NO_DRAINAGE | DRAINAGE
PERM | NO_PERM
.fi
.TP
II. Input parameter section
PFT and soil parameters are defined here. They are included from the \fI$LPJROOT/par\fP directory:
.nf
#include "param.conf"
.fi
.TP
III. Input data section
This section contains filenames of the climate, land use, and  river routing data. Data file have to be in the clm data format and are created from binary files by the
.B cru2clm
(climate data) and
.B  grid2clm
(grid coordinates)
command:

.nf
lon. resolution (float) lat. resolution (float)
grid coordinates filename (string)
soilcode filename (string)
#ifdef RIVER_ROUTING
lake fraction filename (string)
river routing filename (string)
#endif
temperature data filename (string)
precipitation data filename (string)
cloudiness data filename (string)
CO2 date filename (string)
#ifdef ISRANDOM
number of wet days filename (string)
#endif
.fi
.TP
IV. Output data section
Output variables are defined in the output section of then LPJmL configuration file. Definition has to be in the format

.nf
GRIDBASED|PFTBASED
VARIABLE1 filename1 (string)
VARIABLE2 filename2 (string)
 ...
END
.fi
.TP
V. Run settings section
In the last section the first grid cell and the number of grid cells have to be specified as well as the first and last simulation year:

.nf
ALL | index of first cell (int) index of last years (int)
0 | Number of spinup years (int) cycle length during spinup (int)
first year of simulation (int)
last year of simulation (int)
NO_RESTART | RESTART restart filename  (string)
NO_RESTART | RESTART restart filename (string) year file is written (int)
.fi
