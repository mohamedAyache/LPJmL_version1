.TH clm 5  "March 3, 2009" "version 3.5.003" "FILE FORMATS"
.SH NAME
clm \- Input data files for LPJmL runs
.SH DESCRIPTION
LPJmL is driven by monthly fields of temperature, precipitation, cloudiness and number of days with rain. Additionally static information on soil properties, geographic coordinates of climate and soil data, and mean annual atmospheric CO2 concentration are required. Except for CO2 all files are binary data including a header (except for the soil and lake fraction data).
.SS Structure of the header
.TP
header name 
(1 byte char array, LPJCLIMATE (10 bytes) for temp, precip, wet days and cloudiness, LPJGRID (7 bytes) for coordinate data, LPJLANDUSE (10 bytes) for land use data, LPJ_COUNTRY (11 bytes) for country codes, LPJDAM for reservoir data)
.TP
header version 
(4 byte integer, currently set to 1, also used to determine if input data needs byte swapping)
.TP
order
(4 byte integer, values are either 1 (cellyear) or 2 (yearcell))
.TP
firstyear 
(4 byte integer, first year of data record)
.TP
nyear
(4 byte integer, total number of years) 
.TP
firstcell
(4 byte integer)
.TP
ncell
(4 byte integer, number of grid cells represented)
.TP
nbands
(4 byte integer) 
.SS Sorting of the climate data
The sorting of the monthly climate data and of the land use data does not correspond to a standard file format but is a mixture of BSQ (band sequential) and BIP (band interleaved by pixel). You start with 12 monthly values (or with 24 land use-fractions) of the first year and first grid cell. After that, the first twelve monthly values of the second cell follow and so on. Once you are done with all grid cells, you continue with the first grid cell's monthly data of the second year. This format is called "cellyear" in the LPJmL vocabulary and is the only format that is supported from LPJmL-version 3.2 and above ("YEARCELL" = BIP has been used in previous LPJ-versions).
Once you have a data set that you want to apply, you use any programming language, to write the header to a file. In C, you can use the function \fBfwriteheader(..)\fP
in  
.I
src/tools/header.c
to write headers (or 
.B freadheader(...)
to read it)
Datasets can be converted to LPJ-format (including headers) from plain binary input files (BIP) with the executable 
.B cru2clm
that has been provided with the LPJmL distribution.
Data needs to be stored in the same order as the input grid. 
.SS Input data files
.TP
soil data 
(1 file)
data type char (1 byte), the grid needs to be the same as your input
grid / climate data
.br
values are currently ranging from 0 to 9
.br
corresponding soil parameters can be found in \fIpar/soil.par\fP
.br
no header 

.TP
climate data 
(all monthly values, 4 files + 1 file with atmospheric CO2 concentrations)

- temperature [scaled: degree Celsius*10]
  size of header: 38 bytes

- precipitation [mm/month]
  size of header: 38 bytes

- cloudiness [%]
  for internal computation of radiation
  size of header: 38 bytes

- wet days
  number of wet days per month (needed only, if your are using the
  "weather generator", that distributes rain within month randomly)
  size of header: 38 bytes

- atmospheric carbon dioxide [ppmv]
  global annual mean CO2 concentration as ASCII file
  format: year concentration
  Example
    1990 354.19
    1991 355.59
    1992 356.37
    1993 357.04
    1994 358.88
.TP
Land use data

- land use:
  in C data type short (2 bytes), grid needs to be the same as your input grid / climate data
  values range between 0 and 1000 (fraction *1000)
  each grid cell and year has 24 entries: 12 for rain-fed crops, 12 for irrigated crops
  crop order is as follows:
  1: temperate cereals, 2: rice, 3: maize, 4: tropical cereals, 5: pulses,
  6: temperate roots, 7: tropical roots, 8: oil crops sunflower, 9: oil crops soybean,
  10: oil crops groundnut, 11: oil crops rapeseed, 12: pasture (C3/C4 mix left to LPJmL to determine)

- country codes:
  in C data type short (2 bytes)
  for each cell two values: countrycodes (n=197) and regioncodes (n=433)

- river routing:
  in C data type int (4 bytes), the grid needs to be the same as your input grid / climate data
  for each cell two values: one in which cell to rout the water  
                            one with the distance [km] between the midpoints of the two cells

  -9: inland sink or outflow to the ocean
