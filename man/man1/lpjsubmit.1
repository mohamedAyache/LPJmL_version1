.SH NAME
lpjsubmit \- Submit parallel LoadLeveler job for LPJmL simulation 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lpjsubmit
[\-class c] [\-group g] [\-wtime time] [\-blocking n] [\-o output] [\-e error] [\-q] [\-nocheck] ntasks [args ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Script creates LoadLeveler job control file \fIjob.jcf\fP and submits the job to the LoadLeveler queue via
.B
llsubmit
for the LPJmL simulation program. Before submitting syntax of configuration file is checked by calling the
.B
lpjcheck
program. Can only be used for the MPI version of \fBlpjml\fP.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\-class c
set the LoadLeveler class to which the job will be submitted. Default class is 'short'. Valid classes can be obtained by the
.B llclass
command.
.TP
\-group g
set the LoadLeveler group. Default group is 'bios-x'. Valid groups are user-specific and set in the \fI/home/loadl/LoadL_admin\fP file.
.TP
\-wtime time
set wall clock limit of LoadLeveler job. time must be in the format hh:mm:ss.
.TP
\-blocking n
set blocking (number of tasks per node) for parallel job to n. Default is unlimited.
.TP
\-o output
set filename of output file, default is \fIlpjml.$(cluster).out\fP.
.TP
\-e error
set filename of error file, default is \fIlpjml.$(cluster).err\fP.

.TP
\-q
only error messages are displayed, other output is suppressed.
.TP
\-nocheck
does not check input files and output directories.
.TP
ntasks
set the number of parallel MPI tasks.
.TP
args
set command line arguments for the 
.B
lpjml
program.
.SH EXAMPLE
.TP
Submit job with 32 parallel MPI tasks starting from a restart file with a wall clock limit of 1h:
.B lpjsubmit
-wtime 1:00:00 32 -DFROM_RESTART
.PP
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
LPJROOT
defines the root directory for LPJmL. The variable has to be defined before calling 
\fBlpjsubmit\fP. This is usually done by the \fBlpj_paths.sh\fP script.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B lpjsubmit 
returns a zero exit status if LoadLeveler job has been submitted.
Non zero is returned in case of failure.
