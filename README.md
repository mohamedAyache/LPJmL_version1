 README LPJmL

This file contains some basic information on the open source distribution of the computer simulation model LPJmL-Med.
The original code of the LPJmL model is developed and maintained at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in Potsdam, Germany, and publicly available through PIK’s gitlab server at https://gitlab.pik-potsdam.de/lpjml/LPJmL.


Here,we present a new version of the Mediterranean LPJmL model, hereafter called LPJmL-Med, devlopped at Aix-Marseille University
In colaboration between IMBE (Institut Méditerranéen de Biodiversité et d’Ecologie marine et continentale) and the MIO (Mediterranean Institute of Oceanography). 
and is the result of collaborative work, see the file AUTHORS

The source code of the adjusted LPJmL-Med version are available here through osupytheas gitlab server  and should be referenced as Ayache et al. (2020).
The output data from the model simulations described in this study can be obtained from the corresponding authoron reasonable request



The source code is distributed via a git repository at https://gitlab.osupytheas.fr/mayache/lpjml-med_version1  after registration.
The registration is free of costs.

All source code, configuration and parameter files are subject to 
copyright (C)  

For setting up the model, see the file INSTALL


Outside joint collaborative agreements with PIK, there is absolutely no support in model download, setup, development, application or similar. 

New model development can be submitted to the LPJmL-Med git repository in separate repository branches and pull requests can be issued.
